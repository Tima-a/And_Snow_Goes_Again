# And Snow Goes Again
And Snow Goes Again... is a 3D first-person horror adventure and puzzle game published on itch.io, focusing on critical thinking under extreme time pressure.

# Game Mechanics & Rules
The player's goal is to successfully find 8 coins and run the Wheel of Fortune spin within the allowed time to escape the loop.
The game is defined by a 10-minute death timer. The player automatically dies when the time is over. The main way to survive is to alter the current timeline by successfully spinning the Wheel of Fortune, which rewinds the clock 10 minutes. 
You begin with $80,000. Every coin found in the forest can be converted into $80,000 via the ATM machine. Wander the dark forest to gather coins and batteries to power your flashlight. 

Spinning the wheel is the only way to reset the 10-minute timer, but it has a cost:
Base Cost: $60,000 Spin Fee. The total spin cost increases by $10,000 with every subsequent spin.
At the moment of the spin, your current cash balance must be greater than $65,001. This required minimum balance increases by $5,000 every time you successfully alter the current timeline.

If the player finds the Teddy Bear after the third successful timeline alteration (the third spin), you will receive an additional $50,000 bonus.

# Development
All code, 3D models, game logic, Unity project management, and general project management were handled by me.
